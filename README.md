# S1S2-Water: A global dataset for semantic segmentation of water bodies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images
This repository provides tools to work with the [S1S2-Water dataset]().

[S1S2-Water dataset]() is a global reference dataset for training, validation and testing of convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of surface water bodies in publicly available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The dataset consists of 65 triplets of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images with quality checked binary water mask. Samples are drawn globally on the basis of the Sentinel-2 tile-grid (100 x 100 km) under consideration of pre-dominant landcover and availability of water bodies. Each sample is complemented with STAC-compliant metadata and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster from the Copernicus DEM.

The following pre-print article describes the dataset:

A peer-reviewed article is currently under review in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

## Dataset access
The dataset (~170 GB) will be freely available for download from Zenodo once the peer-reviewed article has been published.
